## ResChanger (by longer side)
The entire point of this script is to change the resolution of image(s) by the longer side. 
> For example, you have a requirement that images will not be larger than 1000 px and a 3264x2176 image. 
> The script will resize the image to 1000x667. Same with a 2176x3264 image, the script will resize the image to 667x1000.

## WsipDownloader
Downloads an entire textbook from [wsipnet.pl](https://www.wsipnet.pl) as images and save it to PDF. It's technically legal with their ToS as long as you don't share the book with anyone. 
You still need to own a copy in order to get access to the e-book. Most of the script is automated, the only thing you need to do is login with your Google account to Chrome and run the script.
